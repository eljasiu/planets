# Planets

Planets is an educational site that teaches different planets characteristics in an aesthetic way. Every planet is desribed in a few paragraphs and a grasp of statistics is provided. The ones who want to learn more can click the source link to read further.

The page was build using **React.js** library combined with **TypeScript**. I used React Router Dom to navigate between the planets and wrote a custom hook to update the current one. The page is fully responsive and layouts properly on a wide variety of devices. **Three individual views are implemented for phones, tablets and desktop.** CSS was wrtitten in a modern way with tools like Flexbox, Grid and variables.
